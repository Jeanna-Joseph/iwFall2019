    <p>As a platform, we strive to connect student influencers on Instagram with local restaurants.</p> 
    <p>Restaurants can gain visibility in campus communities and students can enjoy free meals in exchange for their content.</p>
    <p>Sign up if you are a restaurant near a university, or a student with an avid Instagram following!</p>
    <p>Students use our service <strong>free of charge.</strong></p>
    <p>Restaurants pay an <strong>annual subscription fee of $50.00</strong> to use the service. For 12 months of incredible content and building relationships within the campus community, <strong>we at postento think it's worth it</strong>.</p>
